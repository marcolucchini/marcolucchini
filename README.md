# Hey 😄

I'm Marco Lucchini, Mathematical Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano. My studies are focused on Statistical Learning and Data Science.

## 🎓 **Education:**

- MSc in Statistical Learning track of Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano
- Erasmus semester at UPC, Barcelona
- BSc in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano

## 🔨 **Projects:**

- [`Mixed and functional analysis models for studying
Heart Failure (re)-hospitalizations`](https://github.com/marcolucchini/Heart-Failure-re-hospitalizations): The main aim of this study is to provide statistically relevant methods for identifying the potentially high-risk patients in advance and understanding which are the main patient-level features that have an impact on the re-hospitalization.

- [`Estimating Client's Needs using Machine Learning`](https://github.com/marcolucchini/Fintech-Project) : Exploited machine learning techniques to create a cross-platform web-app to recommend products based on clients' needs.

- [`Study Plan Maker`](https://github.com/marcolucchini/Study-Plan-Maker): a linear programming web-app to simulate the best study plan for Mathematical Engineering students.
